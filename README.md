# PayPal
## Overview and Origin:

  Paypal began in 1998 and was actually called Confinity.  Confinity was birthed by technology entreprenuers Peter Thiel and Max Levchin as a security software company for handheld devices.  Peter Thiel who is a German American entreprenuer and venture capitalist who's resume consists of Paypal, Palantir, and early investor of Facebook partnered with Max Levchin who is a Ukranian software engineer.  Max Levchin is known for the creation of the CAPTCHA test when logging in to distinguish humans and computers apart.  Also known for founding popular pay later company Affirm.  The founders of Paypal consisted of Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, Max Levchin, Yu Pan, Ken Howery, and Luke Nosek. In 2000 Confinity merged into X.com an online banking company founded by Elon Musk who is to credit for the vision and ability to see that the future of banking was to be digitalized.  As X.com faced challenges as a very early and first to market company for online banking, Harris and Musk disagreed about the future which caused Harris to leave.  Musk then decided that it was time to focus on what was then dubbed Paypal.  Paypal IPO'ed in 2002 listed as PYPL at $13 a share and generated 61 million.

## Business Activities:

  Paypal was created as a disruptive technology to digitize banking and act as a money transfer system.  PayPals business model is a two sided platform.  One side is merchants which are the businesses that use PayPal in order to make financial transactions.  On the other side is the consumers who make payments through the platform inside of the merchants websites.

  The intended customer of PayPal I believe is anyone with a cellphone.  This creates a global market at a scale I believe is still to be unknown.  Everyone on the planet carries a cell phone and everyone has to deal with a currency of some sort to perform transactions of buying or selling goods.  Currently as one of the first digital banks right now PayPal's competitive advantage is having cash on the balance sheet that most of the other digital banks do not have.  This gives Paypal the flexibility of being able to purchase competition or invest into new markets for continued growth.  Against the traditionals, Paypal doesnt have to worry about the brick and mortar stores or does it have to worry about loan operations involving risk assesment and defaults.  There is a few techonologies that Paypal is creating that is changing the way we do transactions one being Buy now and Pay Later.  This tends to be in payments of 4 at 25% which gives the consumer a very large amount of flexibility when deciding to make a purchase.  Another is now allowing crypto currencies to be used when making a purchase.  This hits a large millenial market as most of the millenial generation seems to be in favor of DeFi.  One of the most under developed technologies that I see growing and will also make Paypal more "sticky" to merchants is the 2d bar code system.  I feel we will use this to remove of what we see as a clerk in all stores.
