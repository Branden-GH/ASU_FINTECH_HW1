# PayPal
## Overview and Origin:

  Paypal began in 1998 and was actually called Confinity.  Confinity was birthed by technology entreprenuers Peter Thiel and Max Levchin as a security software company for handheld devices.  Peter Thiel who is a German American entreprenuer and venture capitalist who's resume consists of Paypal, Palantir, and early investor of Facebook partnered with Max Levchin who is a Ukranian software engineer.  Max Levchin is known for the creation of the CAPTCHA test when logging in to distinguish humans and computers apart.  Also known for founding popular pay later company Affirm.  The founders of Paypal consisted of Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, Max Levchin, Yu Pan, Ken Howery, and Luke Nosek. In 2000 Confinity merged into X.com an online banking company founded by Elon Musk who is to credit for the vision and ability to see that the future of banking was to be digitalized.  As X.com faced challenges as a very early and first to market company for online banking, Harris and Musk disagreed about the future which caused Harris to leave.  Musk then decided that it was time to focus on what was then dubbed Paypal.  Paypal IPO'ed in 2002 listed as PYPL at $13 a share and generated 61 million.

## Business Activities:

  Paypal was created as a disruptive technology to digitize banking and act as a money transfer system.  PayPals business model is a two sided platform.  One side is merchants which are the businesses that use PayPal in order to make financial transactions.  On the other side is the consumers who make payments through the platform inside of the merchants websites.

  The intended customer of PayPal I believe is anyone with a cellphone.  This creates a global market at a scale I believe is still to be unknown.  Everyone on the planet carries a cell phone and everyone has to deal with a currency of some sort to perform transactions of buying or selling goods.  Currently as one of the first digital banks right now PayPal's competitive advantage is having cash on the balance sheet that most of the other digital banks do not have.  This gives Paypal the flexibility of being able to purchase competition or invest into new markets for continued growth.  Against the traditionals, Paypal doesnt have to worry about the brick and mortar stores or does it have to worry about loan operations involving risk assesment and defaults.  There is a few techonologies that Paypal is creating that is changing the way we do transactions one being Buy now and Pay Later.  This tends to be in payments of 4 at 25% which gives the consumer a very large amount of flexibility when deciding to make a purchase.  Another is now allowing crypto currencies to be used when making a purchase.  This hits a large millenial market as most of the millenial generation seems to be in favor of DeFi.  One of the most under developed technologies that I see growing and will also make Paypal more "sticky" to merchants is the 2d bar code system.  I feel we will use this to remove of what we see as a clerk in all stores.

## Landscape:

  Paypal has become a market leader in almost every aspect of digital banking aside from anything that requires loans, investing, insurance...yet.  However, I do see most of these becoming part of their business model very soon.  The domains I see Paypal in are; Personal Finance/Deposits/Online Banking, Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies, Online Banking, Payments/Billing.   A few trends that stick out that have changed the landscape are buy now pay later.  This technology took what the credit card created and slowed down payment processing for the consumer even more.  Currently Paypal offers at select retailers pay in four.  Which allows the customer to buy and pay in 25% increments.  This could be extremely handy when making a very large purchase or even something very small.  Another major trend happening in the world today has to do with the transactions of cryptocurrency and the use of block chain technology.  Major companies in this same space would be Square, Alphabet, Stripe, Zelle(created by the major banks, Wells fargo, JPM, PNC, USB).

## Results

  The impact that Paypal has created is a cashless society.  In less then 20 years we went from exchanging currency physically from hand to hand and in 2020 and beyond phone to phone, touching hundreds and millions of consumers at once.  Now moving even faster with digital currency's taking the charge we may have a society that what we thought cash to be the central monetary exchange to becoming obsolete.  One of the core metrics used in Fintech is the amount of active customer accounts.  Paypal currently has far surpassed estimates by the help of covid-19 and shutdowns taking place paypal now has 350 million+ active customer accounts. As far as performance paypal is leading the competition in the fintech space.
  
## Recommendations

  If I could offer value to Paypal I suggest pushing the 2-d barcode into more markets for ease of purchase.  There are so many more applications that this technology has yet to be introduced into and the more sticky that Paypal can become the bigger the moat will be for competitors to enter.  If Paypal could get the 2-d barcode into gas, grocery, and anything retail, consumers could then pay for the item immediately which would then change the landscape of how items are paid for digitally and physically.  Another idea which I do believe Paypal may already be working on is creating a stock market platform to perform trades through.  With the investment into cryptos and offering buying and selling of, Paypal has really already began this process.  The next phase would be to then offer securities on a similar platform pairing up with cryptos, this would be another massive play on commission based revenue.  Pushing the 2-d barcode into more applications would offer speed and efficiency into the consumers hands.
